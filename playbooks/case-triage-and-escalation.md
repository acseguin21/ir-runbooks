# Case Triage and Escalation

Outline for triage meetings and case discussions. Relevant to: participate in case triage; share knowledge; contribute to more rapid solutions; communicate readiness needs.

## Before triage
- [ ] Pull queue of open cases; tag by severity and customer impact
- [ ] Note any patterns (same product, same config, repeat issues)
- [ ] Have troubleshooting notes or event log snippets ready to share

## During triage
- [ ] Quick round: case ID, one-line summary, blocker (if any)
- [ ] Identify cases that need escalation to product/engineering
- [ ] Share workarounds or KB links that unblock others
- [ ] Capture “readiness” gaps (missing docs, unclear runbook) for follow-up

## After triage
- [ ] Update case status and next steps; keep customers informed
- [ ] Log readiness needs (content, training) for manager/readiness team
- [ ] Add to team or org knowledge base if resolution is reusable
